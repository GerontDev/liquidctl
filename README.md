## Installing on Linux

Packages are available for certain Linux distributions and package managers:

 - Alpine Linux: [liquidctl](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=liquidctl)
 - ArchLinux/Manjaro: [liquidctl<sup>AUR</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/liquidctl/), [liquidctl-git<sup>AUR</sup>](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/liquidctl-git/)
 - Fedora: [liquidctl](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/liquidctl)
 - Debian/Ubuntu: keep reading for manual installation instructions (see also: [#62](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/issues/62))

Alternatively, it is possible to install liquidctl from PyPI or directly from the source code repository.  In these cases the following runtime dependencies are necessary:

| Dependency | Arch Linux | Fedora | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python 3.6+ | python | python3 | python3 |
| libusb-1.0 | libusb-1.0 | libusbx | libusb-1.0-0 |
| pkg_resources | python-setuptools | python3-setuptools | python3-pkg-resources |
| docopt | python-docopt | python3-docopt | python3-docopt |
| PyUSB | python-pyusb | python3-pyusb | python3-usb |
| cython-hidapi | python-hidapi | python3-hidapi | python3-hid |

Setuptools and, optionally, pip are needed to manually install liquidctl:

| Dependency | Arch Linux | Fedora | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| setuptools | python-setuptools | python3-setuptools | python3-setuptools |
| pip (optional) | python-pip | python3-pip | python3-pip |

If cython-hidapi is to be installed from sources or directly from PyPI, then build tools and development headers for Python, libusb-1.0 and libudev are also needed.

To install any release from PyPI, *pip* should be used:

```
# pip install liquidctl
# pip install liquidctl==<version>
```

For the latest changes and to contribute back to the project, it is best to clone the source code repository and install liquidctl from your local copy:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl
$ cd liquidctl
# python setup.py install
```

_Note: in systems that default to Python 2, replace `pip` and `python` by `pip3` and `python3`._  


## Installing on Windows

A pre-built executable for the last stable version is available in [liquidctl-1.3.3-bin-windows-x86_64.zip](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/releases/download/v1.3.3/liquidctl-1.3.3-bin-windows-x86_64.zip).

Executables for previous releases can be found in the assets of the [Releases](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/releases) tab, and development builds can be found in the artifacts on the [AppVeyor runs](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/history).

Products that cannot use the generic Microsoft HID Driver require another driver that is compatible with libusb: for the specific devices that are affected see the notes in [Supported devices](#supported-devices)).  In most cases Microsoft WinUSB is recommended, which can be easily set up for a device with [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)¹: open the application, click `Options`, `List All Devices`, then select your device from the dropdown list, and click "Replace Driver".  Note that replacing the driver for other devices will likely cause them to disapear from liquidctl.

The pre-built executables can be used as is by calling them from a Windows Command Prompt, Power Shell or other available terminal emulator.  Even so, most users will want to place the executable in a directory listed in [the `PATH` environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), or change the variable so that becomes true; this allows omitting the full path and `.exe` extension when calling `liquidctl`.

_Alternatively to the pre-built executable,_ it is possible to install liquidctl from PyPI or directly from the source code repository.  Pre-build liquidctl executables for Windows already include Python and libusb, but when installing from PyPI or the sources both of these will need to be manually set up.

The libusb DLLs can be found in [libusb/releases](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases) (part of the `libusb-<version>.7z` files) and the appropriate (e.g. MS64) `.dll` and `.lib` files should be extracted to the system or python installation directory (e.g. `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Python36`).  Note that there is a [known issue in PyUSB](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/pull/227) that causes errors when the devices are released; the solution is to either manually patch PyUSB or stick to libusb 1.0.21.

To install any release from PyPI, *pip* should be used:

```
> pip install liquidctl
> pip install liquidctl==<version>
```

For the latest changes and to contribute back to the project, it is best to clone the source code repository and install liquidctl from your local copy:

```
> git clone https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl
> cd liquidctl
> python setup.py install
```

_¹ See [How to use libusb under Windows](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/FAQ#how-to-use-libusb-under-windows) for more information._


## Installing on macOS

liquidctl is available on Homebrew, and installing liquidctl using it is straightforward.

```
$ brew install liquidctl
$ brew install liquidctl --HEAD
```

By default the last stable version will be installed, but by passing `--HEAD` this can be changed to the last snapshot from this repository.  All dependencies are automatically resolved.

Another possibility is to install liquidctl from PyPI or directly from the source code repository, but in these cases Python 3 and libsub must be installed first; the recommended way is with `brew install python libusb`.

To install any release from PyPI, *pip* should be used:

```
$ pip3 install liquidctl
$ pip3 install liquidctl==<version>
```

To contribute back to the project, it is best to clone the source code repository and install liquidctl from your local copy:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl
$ cd liquidctl
$ python3 setup.py install
```

_Note: installation into a virtual environment is recommended to avoid conflicts with Python modules installed with Homebrew.  The use of virtual environments is outside the scope of this document.  Their use will also restrict the availability of the liquidctl command to that virtual environment._


## Introducing the command-line interface

The complete list of commands and options can be found in `liquidctl --help`, on in the man page, but the following topics cover the most common operations in the command-line interface.

Brackets `[ ]`, parenthesis `( )`, less-than/greater-than `< >` and ellipsis `...` are used to describe optional, required, positional and repeating elements.  Example commands are prefixed with a number sign `#`, which also serves to indicate that on Linux root permissions might be required.

The `--verbose` option will print some extra information, like automatically made adjustments to the user provided settings.  And if there is a problem, the `--debug` flag will make liquidctl output more information to help identify its cause; be sure to include this when opening a new issue.

_Note: when debugging issues with PyUSB or libusb it can be useful to set the `PYUSB_DEBUG=debug` or/and `LIBUSB_DEBUG=4` environment variables._

### Listing and selecting devices

A good place to start is to ask liquidctl to list all recognized devices.

```
# liquidctl list
Device ID 0: NZXT Smart Device (V1)
Device ID 1: NZXT Kraken X (X42, X52, X62 or X72)
```

In case more than one supported device is found, the desired one can be selected with `--match <substring>`, where `<substring>` matches part of the desired device's description using a case insensitive comparison.

```
# liquidctl --match kraken list
Device ID 0: NZXT Kraken X (X42, X52, X62 or X72)
```

More device properties can be show by passing `--verbose` to `liquidctl list`.  Any of these can also be used to select a particular product.

```
# liquidctl --serial 1234567890 list
Device ID 0: NZXT Kraken X (X42, X52, X62 or X72)
```

Ambiguities for any given filter can be solved with `--pick <number>`.  Devices can also be selected with `--device <ID>`, but these are not guaranteed to remain stable and will vary with hardware changes, liquidctl updates or simply normal variance in enumeration order.

### Initializing and interacting with devices

Devices will usually need to be initialized before they can be used, though each device has its own requirements and limitations.  This and other information specific to a particular device will appear on the documentation linked in the [supported devices](#supported-devices) section.

Devices can be initialized individually or all at once.

```
# liquidctl [options] initialize [all]
```

Most devices provide some status information, like fan speeds and liquid temperatures.  This can be queried for all devices or using the filtering methods mentioned before.

```
# liquidctl [options] status
```

Fan and pump speeds can be set to fixed values or, if the device supports them, custom profiles.

```
# liquidctl [options] set <channel> speed (<temperature> <percentage>) ...
# liquidctl [options] set <channel> speed <percentage>
```

Lighting is controlled in a similar fashion and, again, the specific documentation for each device will list the available channels, modes and additional options.

```
# liquidctl [options] set <channel> color <mode> [<color>] ...
```

### Supported color specification formats


When configuring lighting effects, colors can be specified in different representations and formats:

 - as an implicit hexadecimal RGB triple: e.g. `ff7f3f`

_Starting with upcoming liquidctl 1.4.0:_

 - as an explicit RGB triple: e.g. `rgb(255, 127, 63)`
 - as a HSV (hue‑saturation‑value) triple: e.g. `hsv(20, 75, 100)`
    * hue ∊ [0, 360] (degrees); saturation, value ∊ [0, 100] (percent)
    * note: this is sometimes called HSB (hue‑saturation‑brightness)
  - as a HSL (hue‑saturation‑lightness) triple: e.g. `hsl(20, 100, 62)`
    * hue ∊ [0, 360] (degrees); saturation, lightness ∊ [0, 100] (percent)

Color arguments containing spaces, parenthesis or commas need to be quoted, as these characters can have special meaning on the command-line; the easiest way to do this on all supported platforms is with double quotes.

```
# liquidctl --match kraken set ring color fading "hsv(0,80,100)" "hsv(180,80,100)"
```

On Linux it is also possible to use single-quotes and `\(`, `\)`, `\ ` escape sequences.


## Automation and running at boot

In most cases you will want to automatically apply your settings when the system boots.  Generally a simple script or a basic service is enough, and some specifics about this are given in the following sections.

If you need more control for some really ambitious automation, you can also write a Python program that calls the driver APIs directly.

### Set up Linux using systemd

On systems running Linux and Systemd a service unit can be used to configure liquidctl devices.  A simple example is provided bellow, which you can edit to match your preferences and save the result to `/etc/system.d/system/liquidcfg.service`.

```
[Unit]
Description=AIO startup service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=liquidctl set pump speed 90
ExecStart=liquidctl set fan speed  20 30  30 50  34 80  40 90  50 100
ExecStart=liquidctl set ring color fading 350017 ff2608
ExecStart=liquidctl set logo color spectrum-wave

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

The unit can be started manually or set to automatically run during boot using standard Systemd tools:

```
# systemctl start liquidcfg
# systemctl enable liquidcfg
```

If necessary, it is also possible to have the service unit explicitly wait for the device to be available: [Making systemd units wait for devices](docs/linux/making-systemd-units-wait-for-devices).

A slightly more complex example can be seen at [jonasmalacofilho/dotfiles](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/dotfiles/tree/master/liquidctl), which includes dynamic adjustments of the lighting depending on the time of day.

### Set up Windows using Task Scheduler

The configuration of devices can be automated by writing a batch file and setting up a new task for (every) log on, using Windows Task Scheduler.  The batch file can be really simple and only needs to contain the invocations of liquidctl that would otherwise be done manually.

```batchfile
liquidctl set pump speed 90
liquidctl set fan speed  20 30  30 50  34 80  40 90  50 100
liquidctl set ring color fading 350017 ff2608
liquidctl set logo color spectrum-wave
```

Make sure that liquidctl is available in the context where the batch file will run: in short, `liquidctl --version` should work within a _normal_ Command Prompt window.

When not using a pre-built liquidctl executable, try installing Python with the option to set the PATH variable enabled, or manually add the necessary folders to the PATH.

A slightly more complex example can be seen in [issue #14](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/issues/14#issuecomment-456519098) ("Can I autostart liquidctl on Windows?"), that uses the LEDs to convey progress or eventual errors.  Chris' guide on [Replacing NZXT’s CAM software on Windows for Kraken](https://codecalamity.com/replacing-nzxts-cam-software-on-windows-for-kraken/) is also a good read.

As an alternative to using Task Scheduler, the batch file can simply be placed in the startup folder; you can run `shell:startup` to [find out where that is](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026268/windows-10-change-startup-apps).

### Set up macOS using launchd

You can use a shell script and launchd to automatically configure your devices upon logging in.

Create a script in `/usr/local/bin/liquidcfg.sh` and make it executable; it should contain the calls to liquidctl necessary to initialize and configure your devices.

```bash
#!/bin/bash -xe
liquidctl set pump speed 90
liquidctl set fan speed  20 30  30 50  34 80  40 90  50 100
liquidctl set ring color fading 350017 ff2608
liquidctl set logo color spectrum-wave
```

Afterwards, create a new global daemon in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/local.liquidcfg.plist` that executes the previous script.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/usr/local/bin/liquidcfg.sh</string>
	</array>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>local.liquidcfg</string>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
	<key>KeepAlive</key>
	<false/>
	<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
	<dict>
		<key>PATH</key>
		<string>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/?.?/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</string>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

It is important to adjust the location of Python 3 framework in the PATH environment variable above.  launchd agents use the system profile and thus will by default only find the Apple-provided Python 2.7 and its packages.

You can enable and disable the agent with `launchctl load|unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.liquidcfg.plist`.  Errors can be found in `system.log` using Console; search for `liquidcfg` or `liquidctl`.

A real world example can be seen in [icedterminal/ga-z270x-ug](https://github.com/icedterminal/ga-z270x-ug/tree/master/post_install/pump_control).


## Troubleshooting

### Device not listed (Windows)

This is likely caused by having replaced the original Microsoft Generic HID driver for a USB HID.  If the device in question is not marked in [Supported devices](#supported-devices) as requiring a special driver, try uninstalling the custom driver.

### Device not listed (Linux)

As before, this is usually caused by having an unexpected kernel driver bound to a USB HID.  In most cases this is the result of having used a program that accessed the device (directly or indirectly) via libusb-1.0 but failed to reattach the original driver.

This can be temporarily solved by manually rebinding the device to the kernel `usbhid` driver. Replace `<bus>` and `<port>` with the correct values from `lsusb -vt` (also assumes there is only HID interface, adjust if necessary):

```
echo '<bus>-<port>:1.0' | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/bind
```

A more permanent solution is to politely ask the authors of the program that is responsible for leaving the kernel driver detached to use `libusb_attach_kernel_driver` or `libusb_set_auto_detach_kernel_driver`.

### Access denied or open failed (Linux)

These errors are usually caused by a lack of permission to access the device.  On Linux distros that normally requires root privileges.

Alternatively to running liquidctl as root (or with `sudo`), you can install the udev rules provided in [`extra/linux/71-liquidctl.rules`](extra/linux/71-liquidctl.rules) to allow unprivileged access to the devices supported by liquidctl.

### Other problems

If your problem is not listed here, try searching the [issues](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/issues).  If no issue matches your problem, if you still need help, or if you have found a bug, please open one.

When commenting on an issue, please describe the problem in as much detail as possible.  List your operating system and the specific devices you own.

Also include the arguments and output of all relevant/failing liquidctl commands, using the `--debug` option to enable additional debug information.
